# Grazing
A wiki of useful links for using Ansible with other things (Docker, OpenStack, etc.) 

Just grazing the surface. :)

## About this space
Giving myself a nice way to keep track of useful information about Ansible with other technologies. You're welcome to read it, and you're welcome to add to the wiki if you'd like -- just ask in an issue. 

## Don't stay out pasture bedtime
Remember, folks: Wiki is too often an acronym for "where information kills itself" -- there's nothing worse than finding what you hope is a treasure trove of information, and then discovering that it's old and sad and outdated.

I hope to keep this relevant and up to date, rather than letting it fester and eventually having to put it out to pasture.
